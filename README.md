C++ library for processing AOSL data

Most of this project code have been generated from the AOSL xsd definition
file to C++ code, using the CodeSynthesis xml-tree tool (see http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/ ).
	
If you want to update the AOSL xsd version and get code from it, 
please use this tool and the provided configuration file to generate
the code.
